# ifm-IO-Link

Sample project showing IOT core communication between a C# windows form application and an 8 port IO Link master from ifm with IOT core.

This project uses the OGD592 laser distance sensor and DV2500 5 segment stack light

It also allows user to play around with HTTP post and get requests with the ifm IO Link master, which allows you to change sensor parameters with the right command.
